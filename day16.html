                <p>Hola, Hermosa</p>
                <p>Did you think I would leave you without a page? I know we are finishing this gift and that there is no longer any rush to finish it, but inside me I don't want it to ever end. I didn't do anything crazy this time, I reutilized the logic of the code on other pages and restructured it.</p>
                <p>I know that if we were together, everything would be easier. Even when I make this page, I feel somewhat frustrated. What can I say to connect with you? All these letters and details are made with love, of that I am certain. Sometimes I spend hours thinking about a single sentence, not because I want to be literary or presumptuous, but because I want that sentence to be a bridge strong enough for you to walk across and reach me. The gift is not these pages, in these letters I write to you, it is the fact that my mind has not stopped working for you for a single second since we said goodbye, that I always think of you. And yet at some point I think that these letters should be without words. Just filled with kisses and the great love I have for you. For now, I let the words carry everything that my hands still cannot give you.</p>

The night before we met, the staging was finally complete. All the pieces in the right place, all the right decisions at the perfect time.", source: "Day 1: Where it started" },

I was enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life, until I looked at you and realized the world could be quiet and calm by a brief second.", source: "Day 2: Clean Cut" },
            { text: "I wanted you with an intensity that surprised me. You carried a scent that took over my senses. The dinner felt almost too quiet, so a bar was the best place to let the conversation flow. I thought I could take the lead and allow you to find ease in my company. I was completely wrong. You shocked me like a thunderstorm.", source: "Day 2: Clean Cut" },
            { text: "Watching films has always been my sanctuary, but as you have seen during our relationship, every frame is more beautiful when your presence is the light beside me. I was a man still fighting the interference of a world that taught me to be suspicious, slowly realizing that the best stories are the ones we watch together.", source: "Day 2: Clean Cut" },

            { text: "My love, can you sense all the beautiful photos and memories of what we have lived? Creating this day, made me sense the immensity of this history we have shared. These images are the physical evidence that our love is a recurring line in an infinite, vast joined memory, a specific miracle where the future was already nesting.", source: "Day 3: Distance" },
            { text: "To be honest, what lingered in my mind during those days of silence was a deep thought of you. I realized then that you had bravely exposed your delicate heart, offering a vulnerability that I now hold as sacred, while I was merely following the slow and analytical rhythm of my own nature.", source: "Day 3: Distance" },

But you are my miracle; you look at me, you saw that wreckage, and you chose to sit in it with me.", source: "Day 4: Departure" },

I was scared of the dark for sure, but I knew that you are the place where I finally put down my bags. No matter the destination, you are the only map I need.", source: "Day 4: Departure" },
            { text: "I know that distance hurts, and even more so remembering our past life, but it’d hurt more to have you only as a memory, because memories don't hug, hermosa. I love you, because your specific way of being alive makes the world feel habitable.", source: "Day 4: Departure" },

            { text: "I carry with me, like a wound that will not close, the certainty that I will never again be the person I was in your arms during those days in Melbourne. When I said goodbye to you, a part of me died there. But love isn't simply a safe haven, it's a promise of reconstruction.", source: "Day 5: Far Away" },

Today is just the start of what we have lived and I couldn't be more excited about the things we have left to experience. I see you in myself and couldn't be prouder.", source: "Day 5: Far Away" },

Despite having been away for only a short time, I felt like a stranger; I understood that one does not settle in a country, but rather in a time, and mine there was gone.", source: "Day 6: Goodbye Melbourne" },
            { text: "I realized then that I would gladly trade a thousand falls. Why? Because all those scars would simply be the price I’d pay just to see you smile across a dinner table. It’s strange how in a moment of crisis, your mind strips everything away until only one single line of thought remains and for me, that was you.", source: "Day 6: Goodbye Melbourne" },
            { text: "Those old past days didn’t stay frozen in time, of course. Those days when we lived just 20 minutes apart moved forward with us, they transformed and became the solid ground we walk on today. Because of that, I don’t love you the way I did in Australia, I love you more and more importantly, better.", source: "Day 6: Goodbye Melbourne" },

            { text: "We are not together out of habit or geographical convenience, but because of a choice we renew every time we decide to call each other every day. The ocean that separates us is not a wall, it is a space we are filling with our determination not to forget each other.", source: "Day 7: The Gap" },
            { text: "We have stood, more than once, at the absolute threshold of departure, that cold doorway where the ego whispers that it would be easier to simply cease to exist in each other's lives. We have exchanged words like knives, fragments of a temporary hatred. And yet, this is the miracle, we remain.", source: "Day 7: The Gap" },

I feel lucky that you now walk through my memories with the same naturalness as you walk through my present.", source: "Day 9: Roots" },

I have so many photos of you because they represent exactly that.", source: "Day 10: The Chaotic City" },

You are the most real thing I have in this puzzle of airports and promises.", source: "Day 13: Heavy" },
