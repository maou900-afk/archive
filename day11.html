            <p>I can't lie, this journey was a dream of mine. It may not have been the 'right' time, and as it turns out, it was actually the worst possible moment. But it was never going to be just a normal walk. It was a path designed for two people like us to lose themselves for a moment, only to find who they are in the process. We started walking clueless</p>

It is not just your face, it is the way you occupy the space you inhabit and how you walk as if the ground were a gift, that was exactly who you were when we walked through Cocora. And there I was, just thinking and watching you, screaming inside that it is true and you are actually right there in front of me. Being with you is the only way I have to not be myself for a moment, to become the lens of my camera and simply be someone who gazes at the beauty, yeah, I see no further than you.

It has a double meaning. You are a menace I swear to god that when I saw you stepping in every single slippery rock I was praying for your life. </p>

We had fun, well, at least I did.</p>

                <h2>Falling from the sky</h2>
                <p>It started with a small warning, enough to make me impatient to reach the top and ask a hiker how much further it was. An hour's climb didn't sound like much, but what awaited us in the following hours was something we could never have imagined. None of us knew what love was until the sky began to fall on our heads and we still had almost two hours to go to the next shelter.</p>
            </div>

            </div>

            <div class="storm-text">
                <p>I was horrified, the climb no longer looked like rocks with flat parts and others a bit more inclined and slippery. It looked like a torrential river that was going to sweep away everything in its path. You were there with me, if someone has to bear the weight of this it must be me I told myself. In the end, my love, I don’t love you for just one reason. Our relationship has different facets and in that exact moment under the torrential rain of Cocora I realized that I loved you not only for your joy but because you are the only person with whom I can bear my own pain just to know that you will be okay.</p>

                <p>It is unfair to characterize me as a hero, of course I would give my life for you. I care little as long as I know you could be a little more comfortable. I saw you shivering and I didn’t hesitate, that wet sweatshirt, a bit useless, I put it on you reluctantly even though that meant leaving my skin exposed to the rain. I remember your face, full of tears thinking about my well-being because of the situation, you begged me to put it on, crying because my sacrifice hurt you more than the cold itself. Both equally foolish. But if I beat you at anything, it is in my stubbornness.</p>

                <p>For a while now, that struggle had stopped being against the climb, the cold or the rain that didn't seem to end, it was against the helplessness of seeing you suffer. Every step toward the shelter was a reminder of how little we are before nature but also how much we are to each other. We entered the shelter like survivors of a shipwreck. There, under that precarious light, we looked at each other. We had blue lips, numb bodies and fear still clinging to our wet clothes. It was in that moment, while we were trying to regain the warmth that the mountain had stolen from us.</p>

                <p>You were crying for my health and I could only think that if I had to climb that river of mud a thousand times more so that you would arrive safe I would do it without hesitation. Not because I am a hero but because I am stubborn enough to not let life hurt you as long as I have breath. In the end, the shelter was not that hut with gummies three times more expensive or that chocolate that tasted like water. The shelter was the two of us, foolish and soaked, realizing that no storm is stronger than our desire to take care of each other.</p>

                <p>The greatest proof of my love is that I would have changed my whole life just to have the certainty that nothing would happen to you under that rain. I realized that I love you with my life.</p>

            <h2>The Miracle</h2>
            <p>The heart’s memory has a way of erasing the bad times and magnifying the good ones. The wind was blowing hard and the cold was still biting our faces but seeing your smile when you saw Cocora finally clear up was the most beautiful thing I had ever witnessed. It was as if the mountain of wax palms had been created only for you to see it that free in that exact moment. I was left speechless and simply grateful that the universe allowed us to be there together and alive. I looked around and then I looked at you and suddenly everything clicked. We were exactly where we meant to be.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="letter-content">
               <p>Hola, Amor Mio</p>
              <p>It is simple, it is seeing your gaze. I am decided it is my source of life. How we recognize each other. It is enough for me to look at you to know that with you I am going to soak my soul. And I do not care if it rains outside or if the world falls down, let a palm tree fall on my head, because your laughter is my umbrella and my trench.</p>

<p>Our love grew when we were broken, full of mud and frozen to the point of exhaustion. It might be a revelation toward our own destiny, maybe we are heading toward madness by being in a long distance relationship. We are crazy for living, crazy for talking, crazy for saving ourselves from this boredom that kills us every day. I want to burn, burn in you. I want to know the world with you, explode in the stars and let the whole world be seen.</p>

<p>That is what I feel for us, the desire to keep moving forward, to never stop until we arrive, to arrive at being together although sometimes we do not know where. Knowing that on the way there are these trips, there is our love, our family. To keep moving forward even without any direction because over there is the life we deserve, all the life that has been denied to us.</p>

<p>And just think about it, distance is nothing more than another mountain they put in front of us to see if we would turn around, but they do not know my stubbornness. They do not know that I already chose you as my only possible destination. I do not care about the time difference or the maps that separate us, I swear to God, because I was already there with you, smelling like rain and watery chocolate, and I knew that mess was the most perfect thing I was going to have in life. That I do not need anything more.</p>

<p>A long time ago I told you that my happiest moment in life was when I climbed that mountain in Switzerland alone for several hours. Now if I answered the same, I would feel like I was lying to myself. Now it belongs to that moment in Cocora where I could not stop taking photos of you, dazzled by the fortuitous moment of having you there.</p>

<p>Realize, my love, that we are not just waiting for time to pass, we are building the ground we are going to walk on when finally the map surrenders before us. Of what we will tell our children when we are together and there is no choice but to be the unbearable parents who do not stop kissing and giving each other affection. Those days in Salento represent perfectly what this love means to me. We are two crazy people who prefer a thousand times those muddy and almost impossible battles than an unbearable clean solitude. Not because war is comfortable but because we found each other.</p>

<p>That is why, while I have breath, I am going to keep going up this river of mud a thousand times more, without mattering how steep or slippery the path gets, just to find you on the other side, smiling, trying to hide your teeth but letting happiness betray you, my love. Because I am proud to have lived a life with you and I cry from happiness knowing that you are already part of my past, like a giant footprint of your face. My memories form your face and the future I am weaving with my own hands so that in it your name is engraved.</p>

<p>From your hand I do not let go even if the sky falls on us, bizcochito.</p>
