         There is a profound beauty in the coincidences of life’s currents. Sketch arrived exactly when I needed him, only to act as the silent architect of a destiny he would never see. It is a strange, fine line that connects us to his memory, yet connects us to the gift he left for me. A line that stretches far beyond where he could go, into the life we are building now. I will forever be in his debt for leading you to me.

            I was out walking near North Melbourne on your birthday, just trying to clear my head and take some photos. But you were the only thing on my mind. I captured this image, the finest of the day, the way you deserve, refined it in black and white to suit your taste. You were a dream I hadn't met yet, but I was already yours.

        <h2>My Words to You</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        
        <p style="font-style: italic;">
            I sat down to write about how it feels to remember these first days.
        </p>
        
        <div class="letter-container">
            <div class="letter-text">Hello My Love,

It feels strange to start writing these letters from the silence of those days when Mk.gee could make me cry with just the first riff. I was a distant person then, weary and drained of the courage to love. I was hollowed, empty of the illusion that a love could actually cross borders or that I even had the strength left to want it. Looking back, I find myself analyzing the man I was in those final hours, the man who did not know that, guided by the thread of life, he was about to collide with the knot of our relationship.

When we matched, it was a quiet curiosity. But the things we had in common began to play like a silent melody, a pang of destiny telling me that something was shifting. However, I was so lost in the dissonant currents of life, the same restless noise that steals the song of the birds from our ears, unseen, in the quiet spaces of the world.

Even our naive conversations were already reorganizing my world. I remember preparing for that first night with three different Japanese restaurants on standby, just in case one fell through, you know? I couldn’t mess this up. You had mentioned it was your favorite and that was enough for me to build a fortress of contingencies.

The curated jokes, the quiet walks in North Melbourne, the silent gratitude to Sketch. I see a man who was already reorganizing his entire world to make space for you. It’s a fascinating retrospective. I was building a memory of you before I had even learned the sound of your laugh. I was editing photos for a muse I hadn’t yet met. I didn’t realize that you had already become the melody wrapping my life. My meticulous plans were just the world turning silent, one by one, until the only thing left to hear was the music guiding me to you.

The night before we met, the staging was finally complete. All the pieces in the right place, all the right decisions at the perfect time. The world was silent, the restaurants were chosen and the man I used to be had completely faded away. I have come to the conclusion that it wasn’t just a first date. I was arriving at a destination itself, following an invisible thread. It was never accidental. I simply surrendered to the fact that you had already become my world. And the music was loud enough to be impossible to ignore.</div>
            <div class="letter-signature">Love, Andrés.</div>
